      <blockquote>
        “The best way to predict the future is to create it .” — <cite>Abraham Lincoln</cite>

      <p>After I graduate, I plan to pursue a career in game development, focusing on building games that hopefully liked by everyone. I want to combine my love for design, technology, and education into a meaningful path.</p>
      <p>My long-term goal is to contribute to projects that have a global impact—particularly in open-source education, AI ethics, and sustainability. I hope to continue growing both personally and professionally while staying curious and inspired.</p>
