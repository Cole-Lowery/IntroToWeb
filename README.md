# IntroToWeb
IntroToWeb is a beginner-friendly project created to demonstrate the fundamentals of web development using HTML and CSS. It serves as a simple example of how to structure a static website, organize files, and apply styles to create visually appealing and well-formatted web pages. The repository includes basic elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images — all styled through clean and readable CSS. It’s ideal for students or new developers who want to understand the building blocks of front-end design before moving on to more advanced topics like responsive layouts or JavaScript interactivity.

To get started, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser to explore how each component works together. You can modify the content, adjust CSS rules, or expand the site by adding additional pages. The goal is to give learners a hands-on way to practice coding, experiment with web structure, and develop good habits for project organization. IntroToWeb provides a strong foundation for anyone looking to build confidence and competence in web development.
